## NGC7531 Velocities Explorer

This is a small explorer for radial velocities of the NGC7531 galaxy.
The velocity data is taken from the R language "ElemStatLearn" library, dataset "galaxy". For further reference consult the R Documentation pages.

The explorer lets you select which type of chart to show, either one based on location (east/west, north/south) or by radial position (distance from the origin).
In addition you may select the observations for a given angle.

If you choose the radial position chart and one or more specific angles of observation, the application will attempt to fit a cubic to the velocity data.

In the "cubic fit" tab you may find a summary of the attempted fitted model.
